### Overview

## Project 1: Spatial Filters for Image Enhancement

An image enhancement system implemented with custom spatial filtering techniques without relying on built-in functions. The implementation includes complete development of fundamental filtering operations, including padding mechanism, 2D convolution, Gaussian blur with adjustable parameters, median filtering, and Laplacian sharpening. The project demonstrates comprehensive filter parameter analysis and their effects on image quality through systematic testing of different sigma values and kernel sizes.

## Project 2: Image Enhancement and Restoration

A dual-focused image processing system that combines enhancement techniques with restoration methods. The enhancement component implements gamma correction, histogram equalization with adaptive clipping, and unsharp masking for edge enhancement. The restoration component features multiple PSF generation methods, Wiener filtering, and Constrained Least Squares filtering for image deblurring, with detailed analysis of parameter effects on restoration quality.

## Project 3: Connected Component Analysis and Color Correction

An integrated image analysis system implementing both segmentation and color correction algorithms. The segmentation component features two distinct approaches: a two-pass algorithm utilizing union-find data structures and a seed-filling algorithm supporting multiple connectivity options. The color correction component implements both white patch and gray-world algorithms, providing comprehensive solutions for various color cast scenarios and lighting conditions.
